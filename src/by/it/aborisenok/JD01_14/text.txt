Americans love to participate in and watch different kinds of sports. Many people consider sports 
to be an American pastime. Most Americans are introduced to sports at an early age, as all schools offer
some sort of physical program. Children who are interested in a particular sport can become a member of
a city or a private sporting organization. Many communities offer low-priced baseball football, soccer,
basketball, gymnastics, swimming and ballet programs for children under high school age (14 years or
younger). In high school children can join the school sports team for free. Sports follow a definite seasonal
pattern in the United States. Summer is the time for baseball. The professional players are known affectionately
as the \"boys of summer\". Fall is a football season for professional and school teams alike. Soccer and
tennis are also played during fall. Winter is the time for basketball volleyball, and ice hockey. In spring,
track and field competitions take place at high schools and universities. Golf, field hockey, and Softball
(very similar to baseball, but played with a larger ball, and usually only by women) also take place at this time.
High schools follow the same sports pattern. But they play baseball and Softball in spring, as there are no
classes in summer.
